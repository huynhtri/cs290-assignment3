End: Sun, 01 Jan 2015 22:00:00 -0700
Tasks: Spent most of the time confused on how to connect the GIST server. Most ALOT of time on figuring out how to parse the data
from JSON largely with the help from discussion board. Spent the rest of the time trying to display the search results and failing
to finish the rest of the project due to running out of time.
